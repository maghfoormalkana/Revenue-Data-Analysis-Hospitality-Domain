# AtliQ Grands - Revenue Analysis and Dashboard Project

This project, part of the Codebasics resume challenge, addresses the challenges faced by AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain with multiple five-star properties across India. With 20 years in the industry, AtliQ Grands is struggling with declining market share and revenue due to competitive pressures and ineffective management decisions. The goal is to leverage data-driven strategies and business intelligence to improve market positioning and revenue growth.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands is experiencing a reduction in market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segments. To tackle these issues, the managing director seeks to utilize business and data intelligence to regain market share and boost revenue. With no in-house data analytics team, AtliQ Grands requires external expertise to develop actionable insights.

- **Filters:** The dashboard allows users to filter data by specific city and room type.
- **Revenue Summary:** Displays total revenue based on the selected filters and includes a trend indicator to illustrate changes in revenue.
- **Key Metrics:** Shows RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, and DSRN, with trend indicators for each metric to visualize changes over time.
- **Revenue by Category:** Features a pie chart that depicts revenue distribution across categories such as luxury and business.
- **Trends by Key Metrics:** Includes line charts that display trends over time for RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy %.
- **Property-Level Data:** Provides a table with detailed metrics, including Property ID, Name, City, Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy, ADR, DSRN, DBRN, DURN, Realization %, and Cancellation Rate.
- **Realization % & ADR by Platform:** Displays bar charts comparing realization percentage and ADR across different booking platforms.
